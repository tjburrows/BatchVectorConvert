Batch Vector File Conversion with Inkscape

This script batch converts all files of a specified extension into another file format
in the specified directory.   This requires that inkscape is installed, and the path to the
executable is specified.  All supported output formats have been tested but not all
input formats.  In addition, there are many more formats that are supported that are not currently
explicitly listed as supported.  It has only been tested on Windows, but it should work on other
OSes, except for support for the wmf file extension.

Supported output formats: svg, wmf, emf, ps, pdf, eps, png
