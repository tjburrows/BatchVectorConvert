Batch Vector File Conversion with Inkscape

This script batch converts all files of a specified extension in a specified directory.   This requires that Inkscape is installed, and the path to the executable must be specified.  All supported output formats have been tested but not all input formats.  In addition, there are many more formats that are supported that are not currently explicitly listed as supported.  It has only been tested on Windows, but it should work on other OSes.

Supported output formats: svg, wmf, emf, ps, pdf, eps, png
